# Question 1: Create two pods named "blue" and "red" using nginx image. The "blue" pod should be exposed on port 80.
kubectl run blue --image=nginx --port=80
pod/blue created

kubectl get pods
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blue   1/1     Running   0          22s
red    0/1     Unknown   0          24h

kubectl run red --image=nginx
pod/red created

# Question 2: Create a nodeport service to expose the "blue" pod. The service should allow external access to the pod on the same port (port 80).
kubectl expose pod blue --type=NodePort --port=80
service/blue exposed

kubectl get pods
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blue   1/1     Running   0          80s
red    1/1     Running   0          37s

# Question 3: Create a clusterip service to expose the "red" pod. This service allows internal access within the Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl expose pod red --type=ClusterIP --port=80
service/red exposed

# Question 4: Delete the nodeport service that was created for the "blue" pod.
kubectl delete service blue
service "blue" deleted

# Question 5: Recreate a nodeport service for the "blue" pod, this time using the following custom port settings:
vi blue-service.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: blue-service
        spec:
          selector:
            app: blue
          type: NodePort
          ports:
            - port: 8080
              targetPort: 80
              nodePort: 32711
kubectl apply -f blue-service.yaml
service/blue-service created
