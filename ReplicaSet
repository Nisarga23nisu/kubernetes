# Question 1: Create a Replicaset with 1 replica
To create a Replicaset named "myfirstrs" with the Nginx image and 1 replica using the declarative way, follow these steps:
Create a YAML file, e.g., myfirstrs.yaml.
Open the file and add the following YAML content:
              apiVersion: apps/v1
              kind: ReplicaSet
              metadata:
                name: myfirstrs
              spec:
                replicas: 1
                selector:
                  matchLabels:
                    app: myfirstrs
                template:
                  metadata:
                    labels:
                      app: myfirstrs
                  spec:
                    containers:
                    - name: nginx
                      image: nginx
    kubectl apply -f myfirstrs.yaml
    kubectl get pods
    NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    myfirstrs         1/1     Running   0          2m30s
    red               1/1     Running   0          53m
# Question 2: Scale the Replicaset to 5 pods
      kubectl scale replicaset myfirstrs --replicas=5
      replicaset.apps/myfirstrs scaled

# Question 3: Delete one of the pods
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

# Question 4: Delete the Replicaset
    kubectl delete replicaset myfirstrs
    replicaset.apps "myfirstrs" deleted
    kubectl get pods
    NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    red    1/1     Running   0          67m
